## Plan on improving the project

Add would add
*Call to Action (CTA):
Have a clear and distinct CTA like "Order Now" or "View Menu" on the homepage. It can be repeated on scroll for easier access.
*Keyboard Navigation: Ensure the website is fully navigable using a keyboard (tab through interactive elements).
*Lazy Loading:
Implement lazy loading for images and videos so they only load as users scroll down, improving initial page load time.
*Interactive Menu:
Considering adding a filterable menu for users to view coffee types, sizes, or special promotions.
\*Cross-browser Testing:
Ensure that the site works well across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
